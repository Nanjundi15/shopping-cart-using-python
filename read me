Here's an explanation of the provided code:

Product Class: This class represents a product. It has attributes like name, price, and stock_quantity. The display_info() method is used to print out the details of the product.

ShoppingCart Class: This class represents a shopping cart. It has an items attribute, which is a list to store the products added to the cart. The add_item() method is used to add a product to the cart, and the remove_item() method removes a product from the cart. The display_cart() method prints out the contents of the cart along with the total price.

User Class: This class represents a user. It has attributes like username, password, and order_history, where order_history is a list to store the order objects made by the user. The add_to_order_history() method adds an order to the user's order history.

Order Class: This class represents an order. It has attributes like items, which is a list of products in the order, and total_price, which represents the total price of the order.

Sample Usage:

Products are created using the Product class.
A ShoppingCart object is created.
Products are added to the shopping cart using the add_item() method.
The content of the shopping cart is displayed using the display_cart() method.
A User object is created with a username and password.
Products are removed from the shopping cart using the remove_item() method.
An Order object is created using the contents of the shopping cart and a total price.
The order is added to the user's order history using the add_to_order_history() method.
The user's order history is displayed.
Overall, this code simulates a basic shopping system where users can add and remove products from their shopping carts and place orders, which are then stored in their order history
